# Objective : Automatically fix the subtitles by getting samples of audio
#             and using Google speech to text to covert it.
#             Use the exact timestamps to find a mapping function to the
#             original subtitle

# Main modules :
# 1. Grab Audio
# 2. Detect start of audio : Exact timestamp
# 3. Send and receive converted text from Google speech
# 4. Match string to the original subtitle
# 5. Multiple mappings for more confidence

# Grab audio module
